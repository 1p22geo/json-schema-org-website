title: What is JSON Schema?
---

### Welcome to JSON Schema Docs!
Here you can find everything you need to understand and write JSON Schema.

### What is in the docs?
We have organized our docs in two main sections:

* [**Getting Started**](/learn/getting-started-step-by-step): If you're new to JSON Schema, this is the best place to start. Here you will find a step by step guide, real world examples and a glossary of terms.
* [**Understanding JSON Schema**](/understanding-json-schema): In-depth reference to JSON Schema to help you write and understand complex Schemas.


### Getting help

If you need to ask questions or discuss about JSON Schema, our [Slack Community server](/slack) is a great place to get support.
